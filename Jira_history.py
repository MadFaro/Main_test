' being blocked, that is that all the trunks are in use and the caller
' will receive a busy signal.
' Servers = Number of telephone lines
' Intensity = Arrival rate of calls / Completion rate of calls
'   Arrival rate = the number of calls arriving per hour
'   Completion rate = the number of calls completed per hour
